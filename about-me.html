                    I am looking to change careers from a registered nurse to a
                    full-stack developer. I went to Kenya Medical Training
                    College for my nursing career path. Worked as one for a few
                    years and realized that I needed to find something that is
                    more in tune with my strengths and personality. The idea of
                    programming came from someone who knows me very well and
                    they were right. My first foray into learning how to program
                    was with the CS50 Introduction To Computer Science course by
                    Harvard. I was hooked.

                    It has been a continuous learning process since I started.
                    It hasn't always been enjoyable but it has been, and
                    continues to be, worth it as evidenced by my GitHub account
                    on the <em>Contact Me</em> page. I have some other back-end
                    and front-end courses under my belt from Udemy and other
                    independent teachers like Mosh Hamedani. There are some
                    personal projects that I have built to enhance my skills and
                    solidify the lessons that I am learning. A few of these are
                    available on the <em>Projects</em> page.

                    Having a background in the medical world and personal
                    experiences as a patient, I want to eventually be able to
                    provide some innovative solutions to some queries that I've
                    noticed. These can hopefully be practical, effective and
                    helpful to people.
